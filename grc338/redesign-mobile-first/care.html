         <h1> Swimwear Care Tips </h1>
         <p> After repeated exposure to sunlight and chlorine your suit will begin to fade naturally over time. This is not considered a SLO Swim or manufacturer's defect. But, if you use these tips while caring for your suit, you will get the most out of your investment. Enjoy. </p>

         <h2> Tips for Maintaining your Swimsuit </h2>
         <ul>
            <li> Hand-wash in mild soap (or shampoo) </li>
            <li> DO NOT spot clean or put in the dryer </li>
            <li> Remember that suntan oils will damage the fabric and elastic - use it sparingly </li>
         </ul>
         <h3> Exposure to hot tubs and/or heavily chlorinated pools (like public pools) will cause permeated fading in your suit. To avoid this, as well as to prevent general fading, we recommend setting the color on your suit BEFORE you wear it for the first time. </h3>
         
         <h3> To set the color: </h3>
         <ul>
            <li> Mix 1/2 cup of white vinegar to a 1/4 filled sink of cool water. </li>
            <li> Soak the suit in the mix for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li> Then, ring it out and lay it flat to dry. </li>
         </ul>
